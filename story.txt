Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear TAYLOR,

I am writing to you from a RELUCTANT spaceship in a PRAISEWORTHY galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a TURQUOISE rocket in SEPTEMBER. There are 42 RABBITS and SANDALS of DISHWASHER here! In the
SITTING ROOM there is a pool full of COKE. I fall asleep each night on a HYPER bed of
CLOTH and dream of JUMPING OFTEN. It feels as though I have lived here for
43 SECONDS. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
SWIMMING on a WET KIA SOUL!!

Best wishes,
TY
